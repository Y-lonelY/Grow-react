This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## file structure

### structure

`assets` 存放静态资源，图片，测试文件等
`cluster` 模块化函数方法，工具函数方法，命名区别于 `../scripts`
`components` 存放自定义组件
`style` 存放项目中用到的样式
	- `variable.scss` 基础变量
`view` 存放业务相关的文件

### import packages

moment.js

`npm install moment --save`




## Bizcharts

通过 `npm install bizcharts --save` 安装[Bizcharts](https://bizcharts.net/products/bizCharts/docs/start)

### 图表类型

[数据可视化之图表类型](https://bizcharts.net/products/bizCharts/docs/chartType)

数据可视化的核心在于**可视化编码**，而可视化编码由几何标记和视觉通道组成，图表类型一般指的就是几何标记

几何标记可以根据数据维度来划分

图形空间的自由度指在不改变图形性质的基础上可以自由扩展的维度，自由度 = 空间维度 - 几何标记的维度



















## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
